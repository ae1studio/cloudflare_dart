## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**drainDuration** | **num** | Configures the drain duration in seconds. This field is only used when session affinity is enabled on the load balancer. | [optional] 
**headers** | **BuiltSet&lt;String&gt;** | Configures the names of HTTP headers to base session affinity on when header `session_affinity` is enabled. At least one HTTP header name must be provided. To specify the exact cookies to be used, include an item in the following format: `\"cookie:<cookie-name-1>,<cookie-name-2>\"` (example) where everything after the colon is a comma-separated list of cookie names. Providing only `\"cookie\"` will result in all cookies being used. The default max number of HTTP header names that can be provided depends on your plan: 5 for Enterprise, 1 for all other plans. | [optional] 
**requireAllHeaders** | **bool** | When header `session_affinity` is enabled, this option can be used to specify how HTTP headers on load balancing requests will be used. The supported values are: - `\"true\"`: Load balancing requests must contain *all* of the HTTP headers specified by the `headers` session affinity attribute, otherwise sessions aren't created. - `\"false\"`: Load balancing requests must contain *at least one* of the HTTP headers specified by the `headers` session affinity attribute, otherwise sessions aren't created. | [optional] [default to false]
**samesite** | **String** | Configures the SameSite attribute on session affinity cookie. Value \"Auto\" will be translated to \"Lax\" or \"None\" depending if Always Use HTTPS is enabled. Note: when using value \"None\", the secure attribute can not be set to \"Never\". | [optional] [default to 'Auto']
**secure** | **String** | Configures the Secure attribute on session affinity cookie. Value \"Always\" indicates the Secure attribute will be set in the Set-Cookie header, \"Never\" indicates the Secure attribute will not be set, and \"Auto\" will set the Secure attribute depending if Always Use HTTPS is enabled. | [optional] [default to 'Auto']
**zeroDowntimeFailover** | **String** | Configures the zero-downtime failover between origins within a pool when session affinity is enabled. This feature is currently incompatible with Argo, Tiered Cache, and Bandwidth Alliance. The supported values are: - `\"none\"`: No failover takes place for sessions pinned to the origin (default). - `\"temporary\"`: Traffic will be sent to another other healthy origin until the originally pinned origin is available; note that this can potentially result in heavy origin flapping. - `\"sticky\"`: The session affinity cookie is updated and subsequent requests are sent to the new origin. Note: Zero-downtime failover with sticky sessions is currently not supported for session affinity by header. | [optional] [default to 'none']
