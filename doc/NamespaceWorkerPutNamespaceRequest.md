Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**name** | **String** | The name of the dispatch namespace. | [optional] 
**trustedWorkers** | **bool** | Whether the Workers in the namespace are executed in a \"trusted\" manner. When a Worker is trusted, it has access to the shared caches for the zone in the Cache API, and has access to the `request.cf` object on incoming Requests. When a Worker is untrusted, caches are not shared across the zone, and `request.cf` is undefined. By default, Workers in a namespace are \"untrusted\". | [optional] [default to false]
